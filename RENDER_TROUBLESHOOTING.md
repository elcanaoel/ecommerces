# üîß Render Deployment Troubleshooting

## Issue: Frontend Shows 404 Error

### Symptoms:
- Site shows Render's default error page
- Console shows: `GET https://techcard.onrender.com/ 404 (Not Found)`
- CSP (Content Security Policy) errors

### ‚úÖ Solution Applied:

**Fixed Vite configuration** - Added explicit build settings to ensure proper build output.

---

## üîÑ Steps to Fix Your Deployment:

### 1. Code is Already Fixed and Pushed ‚úÖ
The fix has been committed to GitHub. Render will auto-deploy.

### 2. Wait for Render to Redeploy (2-3 minutes)
1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your **frontend service** (techcard)
3. You should see a new deployment in progress
4. Wait for "Deploy succeeded" message

### 3. If Auto-Deploy Didn't Trigger:
**Manually trigger a redeploy:**
1. Go to your frontend service on Render
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
3. Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
4. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete

---

## ‚úÖ Verify Your Render Configuration:

### Frontend Service Settings:
Make sure these are set correctly:

**Build Settings:**
```
Build Command: cd client && npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: client/dist
```

**Environment Variables:**
```
VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api
```

### Common Mistakes:

‚ùå **Wrong:** `Publish Directory: dist`
‚úÖ **Correct:** `Publish Directory: client/dist`

‚ùå **Wrong:** `Build Command: npm run build`
‚úÖ **Correct:** `Build Command: cd client && npm install && npm run build`

## üîç How to Check if It's Working:

### After Redeployment:
1. Visit: `https://techcard.onrender.com`
2. You should see your e-commerce homepage
3. No more 404 errors
4. No CSP errors

### If Still Not Working:

**Check Render Logs:**
1. Go to frontend service
2. Click **"Logs"** tab
3. Look for build errors
4. Common issues:
   - `npm install` failed
   - Build command incorrect
   - Missing dependencies

---

## üêõ Other Common Issues:

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" or CORS errors

**Symptoms:**
- Frontend loads but can't connect to backend
- Console shows CORS errors

**Solution:**
1. Check `VITE_API_URL` in frontend environment variables
2. Make sure it points to your backend URL + `/api`
3. Verify `CLIENT_URL` is set in backend environment variables
4. Example:
   ```
   Frontend VITE_API_URL: https://backend-name.onrender.com/api
   Backend CLIENT_URL: https://techcard.onrender.com
   ```

---

### Issue: Backend not responding

**Symptoms:**
- Frontend loads but API calls timeout
- Backend shows as "sleeping"

**Solution:**
1. First request to backend takes 30-60 seconds (cold start)
2. Wait patiently for first load
3. Use UptimeRobot to keep backend warm:
   - Sign up: https://uptimerobot.com
   - Add monitor: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/products`
   - Interval: Every 10 minutes

---

### Issue: MongoDB connection failed

**Symptoms:**
- Backend logs show: "MongoDB connection error"
- Can't create users or orders

**Solution:**
1. Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist
2. Should have: `0.0.0.0/0` (allow from anywhere)
3. Verify connection string in `MONGODB_URI`
4. Make sure password doesn't have special characters that need encoding
5. Database name should be in the connection string:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/ecommerce?retryWrites=true
   ```
