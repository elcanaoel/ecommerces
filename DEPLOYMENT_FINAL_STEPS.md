3. ✅ Verify these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node server/index.js`
4. ✅ Click **Environment** tab
5. ✅ Make sure these variables exist:
   ```
   NODE_ENV = production
   MONGODB_URI = mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
   JWT_SECRET = your-secret-key-here
   PORT = 10000
   CLIENT_URL = https://ecommerces-delta.vercel.app
   ```
6. ✅ If any are missing, add them
7. ✅ Click **Manual Deploy** → **Clear build cache & deploy**
8. ✅ Wait 5 minutes
9. ✅ Copy your backend URL (e.g., `https://xxx.onrender.com`)
10. ✅ Go back to Vercel and update `VITE_API_URL` with this URL + `/api`

### If NO (you don't have a backend service):

1. ✅ Click **New +** → **Web Service**
2. ✅ Connect to GitHub: **elcanaoel/ecommerces**
3. ✅ Click **Connect**
4. ✅ Configure:
   ```
   Name: ecomm-backend
   Branch: main
   Root Directory: (leave empty)
   Runtime: Node
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: node server/index.js
   Instance Type: Free
   ```
5. ✅ Click **Advanced** → **Add Environment Variable**
6. ✅ Add these one by one:
   ```
   NODE_ENV = production
   MONGODB_URI = mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
   JWT_SECRET = super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   PORT = 10000
   CLIENT_URL = https://ecommerces-delta.vercel.app
   ```
7. ✅ Click **Create Web Service**
8. ✅ Wait 5-7 minutes for deployment
9. ✅ Copy your backend URL (shown at top)
10. ✅ Go to Vercel and add `VITE_API_URL` with this URL + `/api`

---

## 🔍 How to Get Your Backend URL

### In Render:
1. Click on your backend service
2. Look at the top - you'll see a URL like:
   ```
   https://ecomm-backend-abc123.onrender.com
   ```
3. Copy this URL
4. Add `/api` at the end:
   ```
   https://ecomm-backend-abc123.onrender.com/api
   ```
5. This is your `VITE_API_URL` value!

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

### Can't find backend on Render?
- You probably don't have one yet
- Follow the "If NO" steps above to create it

### Don't know what to put for MONGODB_URI?
- For now, use: `mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce`
- Later, create MongoDB Atlas for production

### Backend won't start?
- Check Render logs for errors
- Make sure all environment variables are set
- Verify Build Command is `npm install`

## 📞 What to Tell Me

If it's not working, tell me:

1. **Do you have a backend service on Render?** (Yes/No)
2. **What is your backend URL?** (Copy from Render)
3. **What does Render logs say?** (Last few lines)
4. **What does Vercel show for VITE_API_URL?** (Copy the value)

## 🎯 Summary

**You need to:**
1. Add `VITE_API_URL` to Vercel (points to your Render backend)
2. Make sure backend is deployed to Render
3. Redeploy both services
4. Test!

**Time needed:** 10 minutes total
