## üîß DIAGNOSIS

Based on your answers, here's what's wrong:

### If Build Command is NOT exactly this:
```
cd client && npm install && npm run build
```
**PROBLEM:** Build command is wrong
**FIX:** Edit it to match exactly (including spaces)

---

### If Publish Directory is NOT exactly this:
```
client/dist
```
**PROBLEM:** Publish directory is wrong (THIS IS MOST LIKELY!)
**FIX:** Edit it to be exactly `client/dist`

Common wrong values:
- ‚ùå `dist` (missing client/)
- ‚ùå `./dist` (wrong format)
- ‚ùå `client/build` (wrong folder name)
- ‚ùå `/client/dist` (extra slash)
- ‚ùå `client /dist` (extra space)
- ‚ùå `Client/dist` (wrong case)

---

### If you're looking at "Web Service" instead of "Static Site":
**PROBLEM:** You're editing the wrong service!
**FIX:** Go back and click on the Static Site service

---

### If logs don't say "Deploy succeeded":
**PROBLEM:** Deployment failed or is still running
**FIX:** Wait for deployment to complete, or check error message

---
